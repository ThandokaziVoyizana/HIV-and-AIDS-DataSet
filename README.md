# Adult cases  of people leaving with HIV across all continents.

Here I analyse a dataset released by the World Health Organisation about HIV positive reported cases.
The dataset was derived from all continents from the year 2008-2018.

From the data we can clearly see that Africa has the most report HIV  cases in comparison with the other 6 continents.
Europe has  the Least number of HIV positive case.
